  const codeOfConductText = `1-Core Values
We expect all members to maintain the highest standards of professional conduct, integrity, and transparency.

2-Communication Standards
All communication is respectful, responsive, and professional. No spammy messages or mass-forwarded listings.

3-Deal Transparency
Brokers agree to clear commission splits from the start, written confirmation of deals, and no last-minute changes to terms.

4-Property Standards
Listings must have accurate information, quality photos, and complete documentation including title status.

5-No Double-Dealing
Agents cannot shop deals to multiple brokers or privately negotiate deals already presented by another broker.

6-Conflict Resolution
Any disputes will be handled through our dedicated mediation process, not through public channels.`;

  // Network Charter text
  const networkCharterText = `1-What We Stand For
Trust First- We work with brokers we can count on. No cutting corners, no backdoor deals.

2-Work Together
This is a network built for collaboration â€” share clean inventory, respect deals, and grow together.

3-Keep It Professional
Good photos, real listings, clear terms. Let's raise the bar for how our industry works.

4-Use Smart Tools
We use tech to cut out the chaos (no more WhatsApp spam!) and make real estate faster, simpler, and more profitable.`;
